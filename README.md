## About
I built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) with MirageJS, I also used Bootstrap to make it organized without having to worry about writing the CSS myself.

## Prerequisites
To run in Windows 10 you need to install some tools, like: NodeJS, Chocolatey and more. [here](https://github.com/MestreALMO/React-Requires-To-Run-Windows-) is how to install all of it.
<br/>


## Running
Access the root of the project with a terminal, don't forget to run ```yarn``` if it is the first time running the project, then run the code:
```
yarn start
```
With that the app will be running! 
<br />You can access it with ```http://localhost:3000/```
